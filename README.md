People usually visit physically to such places/venues to talk to the business owners and get quotes from them. 
This application tries to overcome this issue by giving a platform to the venue owners to list their venues for the users 
with basic description of the venue hereby, allowing the user to make a perfect choice. In case of doubts or queries, the 
users can reach out to the venue owners by call or by sending them an enquiry message through this platform.
